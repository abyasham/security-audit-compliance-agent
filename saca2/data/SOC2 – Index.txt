/NOTE: Content here are my personal opinions, and not intended to

information I haven’t seen elsewhere on the internet because it is hard-
won, little-know but significant facts based on my personal research and
experience. /


    Why?

VIDEO: Summary <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlE2grb4qo0> A SOC 2
audit is not a legal or regulatory requirement like HIPAA, PCI DSS, or SOX.

PROTIP: Preparing for and conducting a SOC2 audit “pays for itself”
because, by strengthening the organization’s overall security posture,
the effort lowers the potential impact of a security breach. The effort
also decreases sales cycles and increases win rates. Cloud salespeople
report that it is “table stakes” to provide a *SOC2 Type II report* to
prospects. The document contains an attestation from a CPA firm hired by
each service provider to evaluate and attest that there is proof the
service provider indeed has measures in place to protect the integrity,
confidentiality, and privacy of data on behalf of customers. This is
done typically each year.


    Status Summary

Our organization’s status toward achieving the five TSCs (Trust Services
Criteria) for SOC2 <#TSCs> developed by the AICPA Assurance Services
Executive Committee (ASEC) is summarized in (this polar chart
<https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/qagsq>, with a line for each moment
of time, starting from A to B to C at completion: SAMPLE:

      Maturity Model Levels

Levels for rating status are adapted from this SOMM (Security Operations
Maturity Model) <https://logrhythm.com/solutions/security-operations-
maturity-model/> illustration <https://7451111251303.gumroad.com/l/zyuba>:

  * 0 = INITIAL = Controls are not fully documented.
  * 1 = PERFORMED = Controls *documented* for each practice
  * 2 = MANAGED = Controls also *follow plans and policies*
  * 3 = MEASURED = Controls also *measured and tested*
  * 4 = DEFINED = Controls also *standardized*
  * 5 = OPTIMIZED = Controls also (“continuosly”) *improved*

BTW, an alternative is CMMC maturity model rating <https://
www.wikiwand.com/en/Cybersecurity_Maturity_Model_Certification> which
was deprecated in 2021 in favor of a “Fundamental, Advanced, and Expert”
levels.


      Org Levels

When considering that there are 17 COSO Principls, that’s 17 x 3 x 4 =
204 items for an organization with 4 levels.

  * Executive (Leadership) & Finance (Budget)
  * Marketing & Sales (to prospects and customers)
  * Legal, HR, PR, IAM & SOC <https://wilsonmar.github.io/soc/> teams
  * Operations & R&D - Physical & Digital Infrastructure

a77f-4ba51ac12796.png>
[2] <#[2]>

 1.

    *Identify a CPA firm* and choose timelines.

      * Auditors are in short supply, so the waiting list can extend
        your certification timeline.

 2.

    Evaluate and *hire a certified external consultant* with experience
    in your particular industry (such as Truvantis <https://
    www.truvantis.com/blog/11-steps-to-achieve-soc-2-compliance>, etc.).

 3.

    *Educate* each department on the need for each control, the audit
    process, what documents and evidence are needed, and how to prepare
    (format) them:

      * Send invitations and track attendance and follow-up
      * Outside speakers to provide perspective and enthusiasm
      * Tracking of activities and achievements by individuals

 4.

    *Survey* the organization, conduct document reviews, employee
    interviews, and walk-throughs to identify the amount of time and
    work to develop controls needed

      * System to survey opinions about buy-in and guage understanding
      * System to track progress on gaps in each control within each
        department

 5.

    *Clarify the scope and activities* based on what customers want
    prioritized against limitations of time and resources.

      * Systems involved and their needs
      * Since internal audit resources are limited, plan *readiness
        assessments* one department at a time

 6.

    *Specify who is involved* and each of their roles, responsibilities,
    and activities to achieve the desired objectives

      * Time requests into departmental Jira/Asana or other planning/
        tracking system in regular use
      * Metrics

 7.

    Prepare the organization for mock and actual audits:

      * Schedules
      * Document *Samples/templates* with guidance on how to prepare
        (format) policies, procedures, playbooks (with linkages)
      * Traceability from Selection Of Controls through implementation
        and assessment (OSCAL)


          Perform

 8.

    Write/revise and review *security policies and procedures* (System
    Security Plans) behind each control where prior efforts (ISO) did
    not cover.

 9.

    *Conduct processes to create evidence data* and System Assessment
    Plans (SAPs) as the basis for audit and reporting during the *audit
    period* (6 months to a year). Processes may include internal and
    external pen-testing.

10.

    *Track and report progress* each week/month on where each team still
    needs additional work, with projections toward when audit readiness
    will occur. Metrics for the Security Operations Center incident
    response and corrective action:

      * Mean Time to respond/remediate
      * Mean Time to acknowledge
      * Mean Time to close (Incident dwell time)
      * Percentage of false positives


          SOC2 Type I audit (single process run)

11.

    Identify issues in audit preparations. This can be done by an
    internal auditor or an auditing consultant to provide guidance.

    A few weeks before the start of your audit, your auditor will send
    you a *PBC (Provided By Client) list* based on the controls
    identified for auditor review. There is often follow-up questions
    with some back-and-forth communication.

12.

    Prepare for and perform a *SOC2 Type 1 mock audit* by ensuring that
    *procedures and evidence* for each control can be confidently
    presented for a single process run.

13.

    Assess System Assessment Results (SARs).

14.

    Manage auditors on Type 1 audit day if that is part of the strategy.
    Challange controls auditors ask for, when appropriate.


          SOC2 Type 2 audit

15.

    Perform a Type 2 mock audit. Ensure that evidence for each control
    can be presented for the audit period (6 months to a year).

16.

    Prepare for Type 2 audit. Ensure that each department has the
    evidence at the ready before auditor arrival.

17.

    Manage auditors on audit day. Challange controls auditors ask for,
    when appropriate.

18.

    Dispute draft auditor report language where it’s unfavorable.

19.

    Publicize/leverage the report with customers and prospects.

      GRC Automation

VIDEO <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tLXJwkCr6g> Vanta.com <https://
www.vanta.com/> was the first SaaS automated security and compliance
system for companies who want to get SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or other
certifications. Vanta’s software automatically gathers evidence and
prepares companies for their security audits. Vanta integrates with 100+
cloud services, including AWS, GCP, and GitHub. Vanta obtained funding
from Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator, and other investors after it reached
$10 in sales.

Reciprocity’s ZenGRC <https://reciprocity.com/product/> provides a
platform for integrating compliance <https://reciprocity.com/compliance/
>, audit, risk management, third-party risk solutions, and governance
and policy management applications. It covers 32 domains and over 750
controls <#Controls>. It supports several compliance frameworks in
addition to SOC2.

KnowB34, founded by reformed hacker Kevin Mitnick, offers their KCM GRC
<https://kcmgrc.knowbe4.com/> SaaS product, which claims “KCM GRC has a
simple, intuitive user interface, easy to understand workflows, a short
learning curve, and will be fully functional in a matter of days.”

    Auditors

socforserviceorganizationslogocpas200x200 <https://aicpa.org/soc4so>
Here, the “SOC” in “SOC2” stands for (“Systems and Organization
Controls”, formerly “Service Organization Controls”) reports as defined
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).[1]
<#[1]> The AICPA was formed as an association of independent CPA firms
<https://insidepublicaccounting.com/top-firms/ipa-400/> (such as PwC,
Deloitte, EY, KPMG, etc.) who are approved by a *company’s shareholders*
to perform audits. Additionally, each CPA is licensed by the government
after an examination. So they are built to be an “objective 3rd-party”.
However, SOC auditing is another line of business for CPAs.

NOTE: “SOC2” is implemented partly by a Security Operations Center
<https://wilsonmar.github.io/soc/>”, but does not mean “Systems on a
Chip” (another acronyms <https://wilsonmar.github.io/acronyms>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Controls

PROTIP: Each GRC vendor and auditor has its own names for controls,
organized a different way.

Therefore, a mapping of company internal names and organization needs to
be mapped to the auditor’s structure.


      Specific Controls

Each TSC above contains *points of focus* – specific controls when
designing, implementing, and operating controls.

Request the “SOC2 Controls List” Excel file <https://
landing.dashsdk.com/soc-2-controls-list/> of 291 detailed points of
focused controls. From Brett Lieblich <https://www.linkedin.com/in/
brett-lieblich-/> at consultantcy DashSDK.com <https://www.dashsdk.com/
soc-2/>.


    TSCs

The Five Trust Services Criteria (TSC) 2022 <https://
assets.ctfassets.net/rb9cdnjh59cm/2sK6Ih6dzy6t7aU6RQvoeD/
d97a2a14609e74a1af1ce9ab0b142b69/92317096_trust_services_criteria_red-
lined_version.pdf>, listed here in alphabetical order:

  *

    (A) *Availability* - Performance monitoring, Disaster Recovery,
    Security Incident Handling.

    Information and organizational systems are available (accessible)
    for operation and use to meet the entity’s objective requirements.
    Controls include fail-over.

  *

    (C) *Confidentiality* - Protected information, Data subjects,
    Privacy. (Additional criteria <#for-confidentiality-c1>)

    Information designated as confidential is protected (such as
    passwords, encryption using security certificates, etc.) to meet the
    entity’s objectives.

  *

    (P) *Privacy* (of Consumer Personal information) - Sector privacy
    rules, Encryption. (Additional Criteria <#for-privacy-pi>)

    Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed and
    disposed of to meet the entity’s objectives.

  *

    (PI) *Processing Integrity* (over provisioning) - Payment
    transactions, Accurate process (via Quality Assurance), Errors
    corrected. Additional criteria <#for-processing-integrity-pi1>)

    System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and
    authorized to meet the entity’s objectives.

  *

    (CC) *Security* - (aka required *Common Criteria* applicable to all
    audits) Firewalls, Security controls, Device configuration.

    Information and system assets are protected against unauthorized
    access, unauthorized disclosure of information and damage to systems
    that could compromise security availability, confidentiality,
    integrity, and privacy of data or systems. That also affects the
    entity’s ability to meet its objectives.

PROTIP: Service providers are regularly advised to limit their first SOC
2 audit to *just Security* and only include additional criteria if
necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    COSO

  * The 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability,
    Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised
    Points of Focus — 2022) (2017 TSC) <https://www.aicpa-cima.com/
    resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-
    of-focus-2022> from AICPA & CIMA
  * https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/
    sorhome.html
  * https://weaver.com/blog/coso-frameworks-17-principles-effective-
    internal-control

The 2017 TSC standards for SOC 2 reports integrate the 2013 framework
from COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission) at coso.org <https://www.coso.org/>, which consists of PDF
<https://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/www/administrative-services/pdf-
docs/Internal%20Control/COSO%20Poster.pdf>: 17 principles
<#COSO+Principles> organized in these 5 categories:

  * CC1 = Control Environment <#control-environment-cc1>
  * CC2 = Communication and Information <#communication-and-information-
    cc2> (formerly called Communication and Information)
  * CC3 = Risk Assessment <#risk-assessment-cc3>
  * CC4 = Monitoring Activities <#monitoring-activities-cc4>
  * CC5 = Control Activities <#control-activities-cc5>

The above aligns with the first five criteria sections within the
security/common criteria.

The 2013 version was illustrated by this 5 x 3 x 4 (60 cell) matrix for
4 organizational levels. soc2-coso-816x844 <https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/300046/148309270-862cf0ca-10b9-48db-ade9-
f1d2e85daa1e.png>

TSP Section 100.08 describes four additional internal controls criteria:

  * CC6 = Logical and Physical Access <#logical-and-physical-access-
    security-cc6> = How an entity restricts access (physical and
    logical), adds and removes said access, and avoids unauthorized access.
  * CC7 = System Operations <#system-operations-cc7> = How an entity
    manages the operation of the system(s) and detects and mitigates
    processing nonconformities, including access (physical and logical)
    security nonconformities.
  * CC8 = Change Management <#change-management-cc8> = How an entity
    recognizes the necessity for changes, executes the changes using a
    controlled process and stops unauthorized changes from occurring.
  * CC9 = Risk Mitigation <#risk-mitigation-cc9> = How the entity
    recognizes, chooses, and advances risk mitigation activities that
    have occurred from business disruptions, and the monitoring and
    evaluation of the use of business partners and vendors.

That makes for 9 x 3 x 4 = 108 items among 4 organizational levels
<#Org+Levels>.


      Aspects (of evidence)

Each principle <#COSO+Principles> is assessed these aspects of evidence:

  * *Operations* - Policies and Procedures
  * *Reporting* - Metrics collection, dashboards, alerts
  * *Compliance* - Time-stamped evidence stored
  * *Strategic* - added

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      17 COSO Principles

Items marked with “FOCUS” added in 2022 <https://linfordco.com/blog/

    Types of SOC2

The “2” in “SOC2” and “Type II” refers to the specific type of report
issued. A SOC 2 Type II report of “attestation” is issued by a CPA for
the service organization to provide to prospective customers. (By
contrast, ISO 27001 <https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-
security.html> auditors issue a “certificate of compliance”.)

*SOC1* <https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/
assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc1report.html> is on audits of a
service organization’s *Internal Control over Financial Reporting
(ICFR)*. It is applicable only to service organizations which perform
*outsourced services* that affect the financial statements of another
Company (the “User Organization”), such as Payroll Processing, Loan
Servicing, Data Center/Co-Location/Network Monitoring Services, Software
as a Service (SaaS), Medical Claims Processors, etc.

REMEMBER: “POLICIES” refer to rules defined to protect assets.
“CONTROLS” are rules implemented (such as use MFA, etc.).

AICPA FAQ <https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/
assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/56175896-2011-04977-
soc-2-commonly-asked-questions-final.pdf>

SOC2 Type I reports address the suitability of policies and procedures
in operation at a *specific moment in time*.

“SOC2 Type II” reports address both the suitability and *effectiveness*
of policies and procedures over a *period of time* – no less than six
months (usually a year). Since this report takes into account historical
data generated, it is a more accurate and comprehensive audit. However,
many companies are not able to adequately generate data as the basis for
an audit until they have adequate controls in place.

*Type 3* reports are a simplified version of the SOC 2 report. It is
designed to *publicly* attest that the service provider has completed a
SOC 2 assessment, while also limiting the information to what is
relevant to public parties. SOC 3 report were created as a result of the
growing demand for a public facing report.

soc2-rpt-sections-vanta-1872x694 <https://user-

[6] <#[6]>

These defined controls are a series of standards designed to help
measure how well a given service organization conducts and regulates its
information. They are designed to provide clients with confidence that
an organization can be trusted to keep their data secure.


    SSAE 18

The AICPA “Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements” (SSAE)
define standards auditors use to conduct audits. Verion 16 of SSAE
replaced SAS (“Statement on Auditing Standards”) 70 on 2011. SSAE
version 18 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSAE_No._18> PDF <https://
us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/
downloadabledocuments/ssae-no-18.pdf> was created May 2017. Its
requirements defines some acronymns:

  *

    *IPE* (Information Produced by the Entity): Companies must provide
    evidence of the accuracy of any information provided. Examples
    include SQL queries or Tableau report parameters.

  *

    Vendor management and monitoring of *sub-service organizations*:
    Service providers or data centers must include controls for sub-
    service organizations. The goal is to ensure that anybody with
    access to the data is adhering to control standards.

  *

    *CUECs* or Complementary User Entity Controls: limited to controls
    that are needed to achieve the stated control objectives

  *

    Internal audit and regulatory examinations: service organizations
    read the latest reports relating to internal and regulatory
    examinations. For example, SOC Cybersecurity examination and updated
    trust services principles went into effect on December 15th, 2018.

The equivalent for SSAE 18 internationally is the ISAE 3402
(International Standards for Audit Engagements) published by the
International Auditing and Standards Board (IASB).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Management Insights

Management of the process requires these areas of insight:

  *

    Audit report countdown: When can salespeople provide customers with
    a current SOC2 Type II report?

  *

    Audit readiness: Are policies, controls, and procedures defined and
    reviewed in each area?

  *

    Compliance status: Are proofs of compliance being generated for
    controls in each area?

  *

    Gap analysis: In what areas do compliance gaps exist?

  *

    Trend: How has our security posture improved over time?

  *

    Future gap analysis: How much effort is required to comply with
    additional frameworks?

  *

    Benchmarking: How are we doing relative to competitors?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Additional frameworks

Many controls covered by SOC 2 are also of concern in legal standards as
well as ISO, CCPA, GDPR, and customer-specific requirements.

Since 2017, a *SOC 2+* report allow a service organization to address
additional criteria from other compliance standards such as HITECH,
HIPAA compliance, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), NIST 800-53, or COBIT 5.
